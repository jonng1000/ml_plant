# Arabidopsis machine learning
This file is for my github repo only, just to explain what this repo is. The other readme file in this folder explains what its subfolders are. This repo is for my machine learning (ML) work, which is my main PhD project. It uses ML to predict how Arabidopsis genetic characteristics are related to each other, and aims to identify novel biological relationships between them.

Complete directory is stored in my lab's Google Drive, this repo only has the directory structure, .py and readme files.

Contains a nested repo, raincloudplots, which is not synced with github as it does not allow for syncing of nested github repos
