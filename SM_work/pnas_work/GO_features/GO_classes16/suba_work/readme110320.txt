Scripts: 
fully_proc_suba.py -> Creates fully processed file for ml workflow.
Adds in suba predictions and random features. Produces fully_processed_suba.txt.
GO_check_v2.py -> basic sanity check
rf_feature_extract_v2.py -> generates scores and feature importances for
*_GO.txt files
Suba4-2020-3-9_15-43.csv -> file downloaded from suba website which has
suba predictions for genes

Folders (test1, test2):
input and output files are shifted into these files.
test1_wrong -> first test of suba predictions, slightly wrong because it has
AraCyc annotation as three separate features (GM, SM, GM and SM).
test2 -> remove above error, still see that ML workflow cannot accurately
identify suba predictions as important features tho
