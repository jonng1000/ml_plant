Created a combined data set with 10 class labels for marek. These
correspond to the 10 suba predictions and 10 GO class labels. 
marek_data.py is the script used, which takes these files as
input: cytosol_GO.txt, endoplasmic_reticulum_GO.txt,
Golgi_apparatus_GO.txt, mitochondrion_GO.txt, nucleus_GO.txt,
plastid_envelope_GO.txt, plastid_GO.txt, plastid_stroma_GO.txt,
vacuolar_membrane_GO.txt, vacuole_GO.txt. These files
were copied here, and deleted once I've used them. Output file
is combined_marek.txt.
