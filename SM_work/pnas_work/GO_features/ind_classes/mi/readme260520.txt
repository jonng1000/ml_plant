Name: Amino acid length, Length: 2586, dtype: float64

Error exists because my target vector y, "Amino acid length" has floats, but mutual_info_classif
expects only ints as it expects discrete variables. "Amino acid length" is discrete but it has floats
since I imputed median values on missing values and median for this number is a float. Should I change
such floats to int next time? Not sure, but can kiv this since its not important.
