mutual information (mi)

Files
Golgi_mutinfo_feat.txt: mi of features, from mutual_info.py (originally it produces mi_golgi.txt but
renamed it to this)
Golgi_mi_GO.txt: dataset after feature selection
Golgi_mi_scores.txt: model scores, from rf_feature_extract_v4_p.py
Golgi_mi_perm.txt: model permutation importance, from rf_feature_extract_v4_p.py
Golgi_mi_feat.txt: model feature importance, from rf_feature_extract_v4_p.py
Golgi_mi_build_s.txt: model scores when it is built from features in batches, from build_RF_mi_f200.py

mi_golgi.png: top features by mi, plot from mi_plot.py
Golgi_mi_feat.png: top features by permutation importance, plot from explore_perm_v2.py
all_build_s.png: scores of models, plot from explore_build_s_v2
build_s1000.png: same as above, so redudant, as i have only 200 features here,
plot from explore_build_s_v2
all_feat_i.png: permutation importance, plot from explore_perm_all_v2.py                      
all_scores.png: model scores, plot from explore_scores.py

Scripts
mutual_info.py: calculates mi of features mi_golgi.txt
mi_plot.py: shows top X number of features, as defined by mi
select_num_best.py: selects top X number of features, according to mi, and builds dataset with it only
rf_feature_extract_v4_p.py and rfe_module_v3.py: builds models, scores it, and generatres permutation
and feature importance
build_RF_mi_f200.py: building model by features in batches and scoring it. Uses mi and from it, top
200 features

explore_scores.py: shows boxplot of model scores over 15 runs
explore_perm_v2.py: shows boxplot of top X number of features, according to permutation importance
explore_build_s_v2.py: plots scores of models when it is built from features in batches
explore_perm_all_v2.py: plots permutation importance of all features
