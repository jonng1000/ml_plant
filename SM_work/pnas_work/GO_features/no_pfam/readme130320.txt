perm_test: using the 10 selected GO classes, used permutation importance
function instead of feature importance function from sklearn, to

determine the important features for my RF workflow
test1: created raw data set from scratch in Mar '20, from PNAS
supplementary data, then did RF ml workflow.
test2: used the raw data set from earlier work done in Jul '19, from PNAS
supplementary data, then did RF ml workflow.

Purpose of these two tests, is to check that my Jul' 19 creation of
the raw data set is done correctly. If it is, my workflow resuls should be similar.
Both test1 and test2 yields consistent results, hence can just use test1 from now on.

Scripts
build_RF_score_v3.py: build features in blocks, to see how model scores improve
build_RF_score_v3_1.py: same as build_RF_score_v3.py, except that it uses less features
build_RF_perm_s.py: (updated script amongst all the other build_RF scripts here)
same as build_RF_score_v3_1.py, except that it uses permutation importance
to calculate the importance of features
rf_feature_extract_v3.py: score model and extract feature importance
rf_feature_extract_v3_1.py: same as rf_feature_extract_v3.py, except that permutation importance
is also obtained.
rfe_module_v2_1.py: based on rfe_module_v2_1.py, only one cpu will be used.
Normally should use rfe_module_v2_1.py.
explore_*.py: These scripts are for plotting
