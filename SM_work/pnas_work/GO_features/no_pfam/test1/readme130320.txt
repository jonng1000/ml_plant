Files and scripts: raw data, data preprocessing, splitting into
processed data (which are _*GO.txt files)

Folders
output: 
- output and pictures from ml workflow.
- has a earlier folder with a repeat of test1 results,
this had wrong indicies on the graph, so repeated test1 and put
the wrong results in this folder, so can ignore this
making_dataset: d1*.txt and d2*.txt files are the raw PNAS data.
They are processed by building_dataset_edit.py, preprocessing.py
and proc_suba.py to form the final dataset, processed_suba.txt,
which is used for downstream work. test_data_nopfam.txt
and preprocessed_data.txt are semi processed data sets used
in the construction of processed_suba.txt.
