Folders
output: output and pictures from ml workflow.
making_dataset: d2*.txt files are the raw PNAS data. They
are processed by building_dataset.py, preprocessing.py and
proc_suba.py to form the final dataset, processed_suba.txt,
which is used for downstream work. test_data_nopfam.txt
and preprocessed_data.txt are semi processed data sets used
in the construction of processed_suba.txt.
