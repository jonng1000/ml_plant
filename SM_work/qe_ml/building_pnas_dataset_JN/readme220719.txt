d2s4 - d2s13.txt: gene features taken from supp data 2 of paper
combined_data.txt: combined info from above .txt files, made by building_dataset.py
combined_data_II.txt: combined from combined_data.txt and  d1s1.txt files, 
made by expanding_dataset.py
d1s1.txt: list of genes with targets (GM/SN/both)
check_ds2s13.py and exploring_final_data.py: scripts to check and explore dataset when
everything is combined
small_com_data_II.xlsx: slightly reduced number of features from combined_data_II.txt
features_small.xlsx: partial list of features used in small_com_data_II.xlsx

Actually, don't need the features' values from the above, as I will be generating my own data,
the above is just a guide for me only.
