find_lca_simple.py -> finds lca for each gene, called _simple as it doesnt create
columns corresponding to each taxon and uses 1 and 0 to see which gene belongs to which taxon.
Intead, has one category called taxon, which has all the lca names. Realised that this approach
is easier to handle than creating multiple columns (which is done by find_lca.py), hence added
_simple at the end of the script name. Produces genes_lca.txt


visualising_ratios_simple.py -> plots graph to show percentage of genes in each GM/SM/no_label
category, based on find_lca_simple.py, hence it has _simple at the end. Also, uses genes_lca.txt
as input.

In tests folder
test_counts.tsv, test_plot.txt, test_plot.xlsx,
test1.png, test3.png -> datasets for testing different ways of
processing and displaying data, can ignore

In others folder 
find_lca.py -> same as above, but more complicated as it creates one 
column per taxon. Don't need to use. Produces genes_LCA.tsv.

comparing_phylo.py -> classifies genes into GM/SM/no_label, and whether it belongs to land plants
or not, and does permutation test to see if there's any difference in their proportion compared to
random chance. Produces land_plants_ratios.csv. Also produces genes_landplants.txt which shows
whether or not a gene belongs to a land plant group.

compare_phylo_grps_plots.py -> plots graphs based on the output of comparing_phylo.py. Produces
the following graphs:
	- all_genes_cat.png -> shows number of genes  across all categories, add number of  1s
	from each category to find the number of genes from each category and taxon. Can ignore 0s
	- only_genes_1.png -> basically shows the above description more clearly.
	- only_genes_1_GMSM.png -> the above, but only GM and SM genes
	- ony_genes_1_percent.png -> the above, but in %
	- only_genes_1_percentGMSM.png -> the above, but only GM and SM genes
	- only_GMSM_genes_cat.png -> same as all_genes_cat.png, but only GM and SM genes
	- percent_all_gene_cat.png -> same as all_genes_cat.png, but in percentage
	- percent_cat.png -> percentage of genes belonging to each category (GM/SM/no_label)
	- percent_only_GMSM_gene_cat.png -> same as percent_all_gene_cat.png, but only showing
	GM and SM

visualising_ratios_lp.py -> plots graphs to see ratios, uses land_plants_ratios.csv as input.


Futher notes
Gene counts are very high so I tried  to remove the no_label group, which accounte for the majority
of the counts, but  the bars are not very informative. Marek suggested I use a log scale but it
doesnt work, since the bars are still hard to read.


genes_lca.txt is the file which has last common ancestor feature (phylostrata), which
is used for ML.

visualising_processed_ratios_simple_v2.py is made from visualising_processed_ratios_simple.py
to produce plots in .svg. Improved code to sort taxon in order and immproved asethetics.
