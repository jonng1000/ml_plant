Note that the scripts here got typo:
selecting_all_species.py, selecting_plants.py -> df_rem_not = df[df['Annotation_qualifier'] != 'not']
this corrected df not used for subsequent lines, so results are slightly off. but nvm as this doesnt
change it drastically.

tandem_duplicated folder contains scripts and output to make the
tanndem duplicated feature
 - contains Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.44.gff3 which is downloaded from ensemble plants
 - contains AT_short.gff3 which is a shorter version of Arabidopsis_thaliana.TAIR10.44.gff3,
   used to test my .gff parser to make sure it works
