identifies no labelled (genes that are not labelled with GM and SM labels), 
GM, and SM genes that are tandemly duplicated.

genes_tandem_dup.csv is the file which has the tandem duplication feature (0/1), which
is used for ML.

p-values for nl genes missing from permutation test script,
hence added here, manually added this to .csv file with all this info as well:
no_labeled p-value 0.0 no_labeled avg 0.08949479138678729
also added code to produce it in script, can do this without rerunning script since the
ans isnt likely to vary much
