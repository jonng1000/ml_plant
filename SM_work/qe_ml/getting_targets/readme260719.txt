Two methods used to select GM and SM genes
1) M1_Aracyc -> GM and SM genes from aracyc, only those with expt evidence
2) M2_GO -> GM and SM genes from TAIR (uses GO terms), only those with expt evidence

O1O6_method_uneeded: another way to get genes with the above characteristics from aracyc, but doesnt
work, so ignore it.

Aracyc_GM_only.csv
Aracyc_SM_only.csv
GO_GM_only.csv
GO_SM_only.csv
-> These files are genes from the above two methods, they are their output files

aracyc_GO_SMGM_explore.py -> script taking in the above 4 files and viewing their contents

d1s1_short.txt -> sheet one from supp data 1 from PNAS gene prediction paper

050819
only_GM_targetsv2.csv
only_SM_targetsv2.csv
-> these are the list of targets created by creating_targets.py. .csv files are labelled as v2
since I have an outdated target file, Ara_GO_targets.csv
-> these files are the genes labelled as GM and SM by both Aracyc and GO methods above (291019)
