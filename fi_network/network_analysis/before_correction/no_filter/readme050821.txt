Folders
without_rz: contains work done when mutual rank (MR) calculation is done incorrectly,
as feature importance values of 0 have not been removed, score distribution is also wrong
as it combines F1 and R sq scores, which doesn't make sense

Files
big_fi.png: histogram of feature importance of all features (has feature
importance values of 0, but this is important)
nonzero_mr.png: mutual ranks of feature importance values, those with
0 have been removed
fi_mr_hist_ylog16b.png: histogram of MR, has 16 bins, has feature importance values of 0

Scripts
build_fi_network_test.py: script to test code for building feature importance network,
final script is written and run on CN

Notes
- some of the work here were done by including feature importance values of 0, but these are
important hence are included here. Work done by including such values, if they aren't important,
are shifted to the without_rz folder, which represents oudated work

- pictures would have been drawn by scripts in CN
