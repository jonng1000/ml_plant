*.png: boxplot/histogram/lineplot pictures showing distribution of counts of mutual ranks
- gmean_fi_hist.png: histogram of geometric mean of feature importance
distribution

create_fi_ranks.py: create feature importance file with ranks

Notes
Have moved files around, so file paths in my scripts may be outdated, if I rerun them,
may need to rename them
