no_filter: work done using all features with their ranks, without any filtering of features
used
testing: testing stuff, to explore why mutual rank distribution is weird (before removing
0 feature importance values)
- tests are done by only looking at GO targets
threshold04: looking at mutual ranks with a threshold of 0.4 (F1 and R sq)
threshold07: looking at mutual ranks with a threshold of 0.7 (F1 and R sq), note all these
are done without filtering out feature importance values of 0, so its considered outdated
