without_rz: contains work done when mutual rank (MR) calculation is done incorrectly,
as feature importance values of 0 have not been removed

Files
fi.abc: feature importance network in abc format for mcl
fi.graphml: feature importance network in graphml for networkx
dump.data.mci.I20: mcl clustering output, used to create cluster of features
histogram of MR, has 16 bins, has feature importance values of 0
fi_mr_hist.png: histogram of MR, has 16 bins, has feature importance values of 0
impt_fi_hist.png: histogram of feature importance of features (has feature
importance values of 0, but this is important)
nonzero_mr.png: mutual ranks of feature importance values, those with
0 have been removed
hist_cs.png: histogram of distribution of cluster size
big_fi.txt: contains all feature importance values for all features
(has feature importance values of 0, but this is important)
fi_centrality_values.txt: network centrality values for feature importance
fi_clusters.txt: feature importance clusters
impt_features_i.txt: feature importance values
score04*: selected features for workflow, needed to remove feature
importance values of 0 downstream
nonzero_mr.txt: MR of feature importance values, those with
0 have been removed
selected_mr.txt: feature importances selected based on MR threshold

Scripts
cal_mr_nonzero.py: creates mutual ranks from all features, 
ignore feature importance values that are zero
centrality_nx.py: calculates degree and inbetweeness centrality measures from a graph, and 
saves it to a file
convert_nx_abc_fi.py: graph creation, used after feature importance values of 0 have
been removed and ranks have been processed
create_big_fi_file.py: create big feature importance file, in a matrix, impt for
downstream work
explore_fic.py: plots histogram of feature importance cluster sizes
explore_mr.py: plots histogram of mutual ranks of feature importance values
process_mcl_fi.py: process mcl clusters for feature importance
select_fi.py: selects only important features
plot_cluster_size.py: from mcl clustering output calculates cluster size and 
plots histogram of cluster size

Notes
- some of the work here were done by including feature importance values of 0, but these are
important hence are included here. Work done by including such values, if they aren't important,
are shifted to the without_rz folder, which represents oudated work

- some of the work here would have been done by scripts in CN
select_mr.py: selects features based on mutual rank (MR) threshold
