diff_ways: different ways of calculating ranks of feature importance values

Files
fi_gm_hist.png, fi_gm_norm_hist.png: histogram of geometric mean of feature
importance values, _norm means normalised
fi_mr_hist_50bins.png: histogram of MR, has 50 bins, has feature importance values of 0
gmean_impt_fi.txt: geometric mean of feature importance values
impt_features_ranks.txt: ranks of features
mutual_ranks.txt: mutual ranks of features:
p_values_700.txt, p_values_740.txt: p-values from different thresholds from
permutation tests
prop_ab_700.txt, prop_ab_740.txt: proportions of different feature categories
selected_ranks.txt: selected ranks of feature importance

Scripts
create_mutual_ranks.py: creates mutual ranks from selected features
explore_gfi.py: calculates geometric mean from all feature importances
explore_gm_fi.py: explores geometric mean of feature importance and 
draws histogram showing its distribution, similar to explore_gfi.py so not sure why there's two
of such scripts
explore_mr_prop.py: explores mutual rank (MR) distribution  and obtain proportion 
of feature categories for high and low MR clusters
explore_mranks.py: plots mutual ranks distribution
perm_test_prop.py: perm_test_prop.py: permutation test on features to see if there's any significant
difference between two clusters of features observed from mutual rank
distribution
select_fi_ranks.py: selects only important features and assign them ranks
