high*: selected features for workflow 
fi_mr_hist.png, fi_mr_hist_50bins.png; histogram of mutual ranks, 16 and
50 bins respectively
impt_features_ranks.txt: ranks of features
mutual_ranks.txt: mutual ranks of features
selected_ranks.txt: selected ranks of feature importance

Scripts
create_mutual_ranks.py: creates mutual ranks from selected features
explore_mranks.py: explores mutual ranks (MR) and draws histogram showing its distribution
select_fi_ranks.py: selects only important features and assign them ranks

Notes
- This is when I ran these scripts here wrongly, but have corrected it, and this is my record
of my mistake
# This is when I used a threshold of 0.7 to select features, but assigned ranks before selecting
# features
# 625 nodes -> (625 * 624)/2 = 195 000 edges in a fully connected graph
