before_correction: work before correcting for 54 tti_cluster features

Files
fi.abc: fi network in .abc format for mcl
fi.graphml: fi network in .graphml format for downstream work
dump.data.mci.I20: mcl clustering output from fi network
hist_cs.png: histogram of feature importance cluster sizes
nonzero_mr.png: histogram of mutual ranks (MR), excluding features with 0 feature importance
values
nonzero_mr.pdf: .pdf version of the above .png pic
big_fi.txt: complete feature importance file, before any filtering
features_pass_thresh.txt: table showing the top 10 features in terms of feature importance, 
for each target feature
impt_features_i.txt: features which pass the F1/R sq threshold of >= 0.4
nonzero_mr.txt: MR of feature pairs, excluding features with 0 feature importance
values
score04edit_contf_features.txt, score04_dge_features.txt, score04_GO_features.txt,
score04_rest_catf_features.txt, score04_tti_features.txt: list of features which pass 
the F1/R sq threshold of >= 0.4
score04_contf_features.txt: outdated list of features, as it included the tti features which
should not be there
selected_mr.txt: selected features which pass the MR threshold for network construction

Scripts
cal_mr_nonzero.py: creates mutual ranks from all features, ignore feature 
importance values that are zero
check_orig_contf.py: check continuous features for wrongly labelled ttr_cluster_id features
convert_nx_abc_fi.py: convert network into formats for mcl and downstream work
create_big_fi_file_v2.py: creating big feature importance file, modified to
correct for 54 tti_cluster features
explore_mr.py: plots MR histogram
explore_scores_tti.py: gets high scoring tti features
get_feat_thresh.py: gets top 10 features, for each feature as class target
plot_cluster_size.py: plots histogram of feature importance cluster size
select_fi_v2.py: selects only important features
select_mr.py: selects feature pairs based on MR threshold
