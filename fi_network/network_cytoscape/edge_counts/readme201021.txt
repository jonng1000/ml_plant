Scripts
plot_all_edge_counts.py: plots histogram of features by number of edges from diff feature categories
plot_edge_counts.py: plots histogram of DGE features by number of edges from diff DGE expt, also
sorts number of DGE edges for each DGE feature, number of edges divided into different categories
count_all_edges.py: counts and sorts number of edges for each feature, number of edges divided into
different categories
count_dge_edges.py: counts number of DGE edges for each DGE feature, number of edges divided into
different categories
