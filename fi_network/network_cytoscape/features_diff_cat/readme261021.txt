Scripts
label_edges_diff_cat.py: count number of edges per feature, and divide this number 
into features belong to the same and different category

Files
features_diff_cat.cys: cytoscape file looking at feature network, where specific features,
based on their edge counts (divided into different categories), are looked at
overall_edges.csv: list of all edges in the network, obtained from
D:\GoogleDrive\machine_learning\fi_network\network_cytoscape\overall_network
edges_category_type.txt: edge counts per feature, which is divided into features 
belonging to the same and different category
feature_counts*.txt: from edge counts file (edges_category_type.txt is associated with it),
top and bottom 10 number of features according to edge counts, 
this ranking ignores the top 2 features, as they are coe_cluster_size and 
agn_cluster_size, which are obvious from my overall network analysis,
and is not useful. Edge counts file is at
D:\GoogleDrive\machine_learning\fi_network\network_cytoscape\edge_counts\sorted_all_nodes_counts.txt
- feature_counts.txt: top 10 features
- feature_counts2.txt: next top 10 features
- feature_counts_bot.txt: bottom 10 features
- feature_counts_bot2.txt: next bottom 10 features
new_names.txt: has detailed names (more useful) for GO and DGE features, from
D:\GoogleDrive\machine_learning\fi_network\network_cytoscape\overall_network\for_marek
