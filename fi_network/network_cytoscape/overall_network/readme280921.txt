for_marek: cytoscape file created specially for marek, along with
other files used for it (but i realised i also used the cytoscape file here for 
some downstream work since its nodes naming scheme is improved)

Files
heatmap_deg.pdf: heatmap showing feature degree distribution
circular.graphml_1.pdf: circular network, to help in designing network picture
*.pdf files: files to help in creating publication pics, can guess what file is based on its
name
