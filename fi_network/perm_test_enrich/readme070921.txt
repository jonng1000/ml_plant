dump.data.mci.I20: mcl clustering output
barplot_explore.png: barplot showing number of enriched feature categories per cluster
focused_barplot_explore.png: narrow view of above, shows specific clusters with >1
enriched feature categories
heatmap_sign.png: heatmap showing enriched feature categories per cluster
overlap_heatmap.png: simplified heatmap from the above, to show co-occurence of enriched
categories more clearly
categories_orig_prop.txt: original proportion of feature categories in clusters
feat_cat_info.txt: feature category info file
pvalue_corrected.txt: corrected p-values
pvalue_fcat.txt: raw p-values
pvalue_fcat_test.txt: similar to pvalue_fcat.txt, for testing, can ignore

Scripts
calculate_orig_prop.py: calculate original proportion of feature categories in clusters
create_feat_cat_info.py: create feature category info file
fc_perm_test.py: permutation test to see if proportion of feature categories in clusters is 
statistically significant
focus_overlap.py: plots simplified heatmap
plot_heatmap_sign.py: plots heatmap, statistically significant enriched/depleted feature 
categories in clusters
plot_overlap.py: plots simpler barplot
