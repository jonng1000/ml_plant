Folders
logs, output: random folders creating when I was testing various cytoscape related software,
not important

Files
overall.graphml.cyjs: overall network, for sk in some format which he can parse easily
- overall2.cyjs: updated version of this
complete_sk.cys: overall cytoscape network for sk, has overall and dge info inside, this is the most
updated version so use this, probably used to make the above cyjs files
overall_sk.graphml, overall_sk2.graphml: network in graphml format, the file with 2 is the updated
one, used to make complete_sk.cys
overallData.json: feature info from overall_sk.graphml, but this is outdated
styles.json: styles file in json format for sk (outdated, dont use)
- styles2.json is the updated one
dge_5.graphml default edge.csv: supplies dge style info to cytoscape, from
G:\My Drive\machine_learning\fi_network\network_cytoscape\DGE_network\all_DGE_grps
orig_nodes_network.csv: original node names from network
typo_nodes_network.csv: used to help correct typos in orig_nodes_network.csv
corrected_typos_pre.txt: corrected many typos in feature names, where spaces was accidentally
replaced with _ a long time ago
corrected_typos_pre.xlsx: used Excel to check typo correction, and to correct typos in the new_name
column by merging both the old version of it, and the corrected version of the name column
- Initially created a txt file from this to manually removed " using Notepad++,
and corrected typo in description column for dge_E-GEOD-54680_4_up and
dge_E-GEOD-54680_5_down features. This typo is prob due to Excel modifying my values
- However for some strange reason, Cytoscape can't read the txt file but can read the Excel file,
hence just imported the Excel file into Cytoscape and corrected the DGE feature there
- corrected_typos_db.txt is the Excel file exported to .txt format for backend
my_features_180122_explore.xlsx: used to help me get feature info in assigning good feature names
for web database
partial.xlsx, processed_stage3.xlsx: files probably used to help create good feature names
for web database, but probably not used as they are superceded by their related files in the
G:\My Drive\machine_learning\ml_database\development_files
ranking_calculations.xlsx: used to discuss with Marek FRS calculations

Scripts
cyto_parser.py: exploring some cytoscape related tools
edit_node_typos.py: editing typos in nodes
get_network_nodes.py: original script to identify first neighbours of a node in the network
- *repo.py: an outdated repo version of this
