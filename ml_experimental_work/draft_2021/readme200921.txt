output_interpro: ml scores when interpro computational GO terms
are used to predict experimental GO class targets
output_tair: ml scores when tair computational GO terms
are used to predict experimental GO class targets

Files
class_labels_go.txt: GO class targets for ml
combined_scores.txt: combined scores from different feature sets
GO_counts.txt: GO terms with genes associated with each one, along
with gene counts per term
go_targets_dataset.txt: experimental GO class targets from tair,
for ml
go_features_interpro.txt: GO features from interpro, for ml
go.obo: GO database
boxplot_scores.png, boxplot_interpro_scores.png, ml scores when tair and interpro
computational GO terms are used as features, respectively
boxplot_compare_scores.png: compare scores from different feature sets

Scripts
create_go_features_interpro.py: create interpro computational GO features
go_labels.py: 
go_terms_counter.py: counts number of genes in each GO terms, both computational
and experimental
plot_boxplot_scores.py: visualises distributions of oob F1 scores of all GO classes
combine_scores.py: combine scores from different feature sets, put into one dataframe for
easy plotting
plot_combined_box_scores.py: plot boxplot to compare scores from different feature sets

Misc
go_dataset.txt: renamed as go_targets_dataset.txt, this is the GO features file originally
built with experimental GO terms, but in this workflow, they will be used as class targets
