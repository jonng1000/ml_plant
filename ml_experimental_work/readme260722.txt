draft_2021: experimental GO work in 2021, but can ignore and only refer if needed
interpro_GO_features: GO features from interproscan (from interpro features used for
ml project)
tair_gaf: contains TAIR GO database

Files
AT1G04250_GO_features.txt: AT1G04250 GO features, for troubleshooting
atg_GO_features_test.txt: GO features, for troubleshooting
atg_GO_features.txt: GO features, bigger file, but also for troubleshooting
atg_GO_features_corrected.txt: GO features, corrected file
go.obo: main GO database
tair.gaf.gz: gzipped version of tair_gaf

Script
get_GO_counts.py: getting all GO terms from GO database, explore and clean data, and get
GO features for ml
explore_GO.py: create expt GO terms as targets for ml, but got error so decided
not to continue this

Notes:
This is experimental work which is not part of my phd, exploring how using only GO features,
including computational terms, is useful for ml GO prediction. But turns out their performance
is still very poor
