output: results from ml workflow, contains feature importance,
scores and pickled models
output.zip: zipped output

Files
combined_boxplot.png, combined_hist.png: visualises score distributions of features,
histogram has log10 y axis
combined_hist_nolog.png: histogram score distribution of features, y axis is not log10
class_labels_contf.txt: list of continuous features as targets for ml workflow
high_contf_features.txt: high scoring continuous features, R sq >= 0.7, for building
network
score04_contf_features.txt: same as high_contf_features.txt but with a  R sq >= 0.4 threshold
high_labels.txt: high scoring job ids, R sq >= 0.7, for building
network
labels_0_4.txt: same as high_labels.txt but with a  R sq >= 0.4 threshold
log290621_9.txt: log file from ml workflow
ml_dataset_mod.txt: modified ml dataset, replaced spaces with _
-> don't actually need this anymore, as my corrected workflow removes the need for this
mod_class_labels_contf.txt: maps job id number to target for ml workflow

Scripts
create_contf_targets.py: creates list of continuous features as targets to use in my ml
workflow
convert_labels.py: convert high scoring job ids, R sq >= 0.7, to their corresponding
continuous features names
explore_scores_rsq.py: explore scores from ml workflow, for continuous features
mod_data_contf.py: modifies ml dataset, replacing spaces with _, to make it compatible with my
workflow -> don't actually need this anymore, as my corrected workflow removes the need for this
modify_contf_targets.py: modifies list of continuous features as targets, adds in job id, to use
in my ml workflow
parse_log_file.py: checks log files for unexpected error messages pertaining to problems
parsing certain features
visualise_boxplot_scores_contf.py, visualise_hist_scores_contf.py: 
visualises distributions of oob R^2 scores of continuous features,
those which scored well and those which did not. These scripts produce different types of plots.
Histogram script has log10 y axis. 

Notes:
Plots of scores may not be accurate as 54 tti_ prefixed features have been mislabeled as continuous 
when they should have been categorical, hence this would have changed the frequency of scores, and
affect the plots. However, these plots would not be used as they are too general so nevermind.
