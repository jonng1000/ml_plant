cores_time.png: shows time taken when number of cores are varied
- .svg version is for publication
oob_acc.png, oob_f1.png: shows scores
scatterplot.png, scatterplot_line.png: shows the relationship between GO
class size and model score, _line suffix means GO class size is log transformed
jointplot_scatter.png, jointplot_scatter_line.png: Same as scatterplot.png and
scatterplot_line.png, but is a joint plot as it shows a histogram. 
_line suffix means GO class size is log transformed
jointplot_scatter_line.svg: .svg version of the .png pic, for publication
