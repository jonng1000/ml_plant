output_ran100: output from ml workflow, comparing real data with randomised data, shuffled 100 times
output_ran100_add: output from ml workflow, comparing real data with randomised data, 
shuffled 100 times, 4 GO classes here since workflow didnt run these, not sure why, so reran my
workflow on these classes again
