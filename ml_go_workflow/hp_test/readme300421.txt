hp_freq_info: work done on analysing hp freq results from hp tests
- all_hp_counts.txt, all_hp_counts_diff.txt: output from my analyse_hp.py,
analyse_hp_diff.py scripts, contains hp counts for plotting
- hp_counts_combined.xlsx: excel sheet from all_hp_counts.txt, all_hp_counts_diff.txt, compiled
version for supp table in publication
- plot_hp_diff_pub.py: plots freq of hp groups, cuts off x-axis where
logical to do so, for publication
- plot_hp_counts.py, plot_hp_counts_diff.py: plots hp tests results, see script for specifics
- analyse_hp.py, analyse_hp_diff.py: processes hp tests results into a format
which is convenient for plotting, see script for specifics
- *.svg, *.png: pics of hp results and scores

compare_random: done early Oct 2021, basically comparing my chosen hps with real
ml data and randomly shuffled ml data

outdated: has output_16chp and output_71chp not sure what it is, so ignore

Files
hp_update270421.pptx: my notes on my results, conclusions, and future plans
*_allhps.png: pics from comparing scores from diff types of hps selected
 - those that have _v2: improved versions, for publication
GO_term_desc.txt: maps GO terms to their descriptions
GO_term_desc.xlsx: excel version of GO_term_desc.txt, for publication
hp_targets_desc.txt: sizes of GO terms for some GO categories, to help
design the corresponding supplementary table with such info, for HP optimisation

Scripts
compare_ms.py: checks to see if 16 GO classes from marek's selection is in
the 71 classes used for my hp test
plots_go_scores_oobf1.py: plots hp tests scores, see script for specifics
plot_score_compare.py: compares model scores between default and optimised hps
plot_score_compare_v2.py: Updated version of plot_score_compare.py
plot_score_compare_all.py: compares model scores between different types of hps used
plot_lineplot_compare_all.py: same as plot_score_compare_all.py, but diff plot is drawn
explore score_allhps.py: just some basic exploring of scores
plot_lineplot_compare_all_v2.py: improved version of plot_lineplot_compare_all.py,
for publication
testing_models.py: just to figure out how to unpack pickled models

Misc (can delete it once i think its not needed) 
redo comparision between chosen n default hps, just to check
