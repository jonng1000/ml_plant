Folders
all_data: all my features, copied from their respective folders
figures: contains plots from model scores
labels_16_data: contains 16 cellular location datasets, for ml training
labels_16_data_ran: same as labels_16_data, but with randomly shuffled feature
values
results: contains results from running my ml workflow, used to make plots in
figures folder
results_ran: same as results folder, but data used would be those with randomly shuffled feature
values
test_env: test environment to test various things, files and folders here would be
loosely similar to ml_runs_v2 contents

Files
feature_type.txt: Shows which features are categorical and continuous, based on
their prefix
ml_dataset.txt: All features in one file, produced from assemble_ml_data.py
ml_data_label.txt: All features and one class label in one file, used for ml.
Produced from label_ml_data.py
ml_16_labels.txt: Produced from all_labels_ml.py
ml_16l_edited.txt: Downcasted form of ml_16_labels.txt, used for ml workflow
ml_data_label_scores.txt: ml scores, produced by running ml*.py scripts
small_test.txt: Small dataset for testing
top20_fi_ran.txt: top 20 features, when feature values are randomised
cell_loc_clusters.txt: input file for permuation test, used in perm_t_wrap.sh
perm_test_results.xlsx: record and notes for perm test results

Scripts
assemble_ml_data.py: Assembles all features into one file for downstream ml work.
Takes in all files from all_data folder, and produces ml_dataset.txt
all_labels_ml.py: Labels my ml dataset with all 16 class labels, 
takes in ml_dataset.txt and produces ml_data_labels.txt
create_small_set.py: Creates a small dataset from the original ml dataset, for
rapid testing purposes
downcast_ml.py: Downcasts data type in ml dataset to save memory, takes in
ml_16_labels.txt and produces ml_16l_edited.txt
plots_c16_v3.py: Improved version of plots_c16_v2.py, used for 2TAC presentation
plots_c16_v2.py: Improved version of plots_c16.py
plots_c16.py: Takes in scores from results folder and visualises it
plots_fi.py: Takes in feature importances from results folder and visualises it
sep_labels_ml .py: Takes in dataset with 16 class labels, and separates it into
16 individual datasets with one class label. Takes in ml_16l_edited.txt.
test_downcast.py: Testing downcast process
perm_t_wrap.sh: Wrapper script for permutation test, takes in cell_loc_clusters.txt
perm_test_gc.py: Permutation test
ran_fi_t20_v2.py: Get mean feature importances for all 16 cellular locations and 
selects top 20 from them
plots_ran_fi_v2.py: Plots feature importances for all 16 cellular locations, when feature
values are randomised
plot_fi.py_v3.py: Plots feature importance, improved version of plot_fi_v2.py, used
for 2TAC presentation
plot_fi.py_v2a.py: Plots feature importance, for testing purpose, not used
plot_fi.py_v2.py: Plots feature importance, improved version of plot_fi.py
plot_fi.py: Plots feature importance
plots_fi_line.py: Plots feature importances for all 16 cellular locations and draws 
a line corresponding to the feature importances from randomised feature values. Not
used
