results: results from hyperparameter (hp) tests, from cn
test_environment: for testing purpose

Files
*.svg: plots showing results
- high.svg: plots with GO terms with high scores
- med.svg: plots with GO terms with med scores
- low.svg: plots with GO terms with high scores
- those plots with _diff: plots same thing, but counts each set of parameters as one group
- scores_oob.svg: oob score
*.xlsx: shows the GO terms which is used for hp tests. 1st version has smaller number of GO
terms, used when 5 iterations of random search is used. _v2 has larger number of GO
terms, used when 10 and 20 iterations of random search is used.
all_hp_counts.txt: output from analyse_hp.py
- with _diff: is same thing, but counts each set of parameters as one group
ct_go_hp.txt, ct_go_hp_v2.txt: .txt version of their .xlsx counterpart, for use in my scripts
- these contain the classes used for hp_trial_5, hp_trial_10, hp_trial_20
marek_update_050221.pptx: outdated update for marek, can ignore
hp5_update_100321.pptx:update for marek

Scripts
analyse_hp.py: prep hp test results for plotting
- with _diff: does same thing, but counts each set of parameters as one group
- analyse_hp_v2.py: corrected version of analyse_hp.py, so use this instead
plot_hp_counts: plots hp test results, takes in output from analyse_hp.py
- with _diff: does same thing, but counts each set of parameters as one group
plots_go_scores_oob.py: plots oob scores for each GO term
