ml_runs:
Running my ml pipeline, tweaking it and looking at the results

ml_runs_v2:
Second version of the above, made improvements to my workflow

ml_runs_v3:
Third version of the above, made improvements to my workflow

ml_runs_v4:
Fourth version of the above, made improvements to my workflow. Also has hyperparameter (hp)
and time tests. Time tests is to time the amount of time taken for various ml algos on my
dataset

trial_run: tested a workflow on my dataset, using sklean
pipelines and columntransformer to create a better workflow.
Explained in more details below
- run_rf_1tts.py: Runs random forest forest with one train
test split. Uses pipelines and columntransformer to create
an efficient, clean workflow which trains model while preventing
data leakage
- run_rf_cv.py: Based on run_rf_1tts.py, but runs model with 5-fold
cv instead
- run_rf_mr.py: Based on run_rf_1tts.py, but runs model with
undersampling of the majority class, and 100 train test splits.
Produces scores stored in Golgi_apparatus_scores.txt
- explore_scores.py: Plot boxplot of random forest scores, takes in
Golgi_apparatus_scores.txt and produces all_scores.png
Golgi_apparatus_GO.txt: dataset for model training
Golgi_apparatus_scores.txt: scores after 100 models were trained
all_scores_png: boxplot of scores from Golgi_apparatus_scores.txt

misc_data_processing:
Not sure what these scripts and files are for, could have been useful for data_preprocessing and
data_preprocessing_v2 folders, so can check this folder if I am doing work related to these 2 folders
in the future
