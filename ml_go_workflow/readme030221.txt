Folders
all_data: all features from their respective folders, to find out their details go to
D:\GoogleDrive\machine_learning\my_features and look at each feature folders
- put all features here so that its easy to accesss them for ml work

contf_runs: ml workflow on all continuous features as targets

cores_test: test to see how time taken to run ml workflow varies with number of cores

dge_runs: ml workflow on all DGE features as targets

go_runs: ml workflow on all of my GO classes

hp_test: test to deterine what are the best hps to use with my ml workflow

older_ml_runs: older ml work done from Oct 2020 to Mar 2021, on the unfinished set of featues

rest_catf_runs: ml workflow on all other categorical features (non GO and DGE) as targets

time_trial: measuring time taken for different ml models (edited the organisation of these files
130821)

tti_runs: Corrected runs on 54 tti prefixed features, this are supposed to be categorical features
but have been mislabelled as continuous. So downstream analysis of features will need to use this,
together with the other results (scores, feature importance etc), and delete the wrong results

Files
feature_type.txt: List of feature types for ml work
ml_dataset.txt: ML dataset with all features
ml_dataset_dc.txt: Downcasted ml dataset for ml work
test_dataset.txt: small test dataset to test my ml scripts, produced from test_dataset.py,
has GO:0016020 and GO:0005829 GO classes for testing
- scripts with this name but with diff prefixes: for DGE, continuous, other categorical features

Scripts
combined_data.py: combines all features in all_data folder to produce complete dataset for ml,
outputs ml_dataset.txt
downcast_ml_v2.py: Takes ml_dataset.txt and downcasts it so that simpler datatypes are used,
which would save memory. Outputs ml_dataset_dc.txt.
test_dataset.py: creates a small test dataset to test my ml scripts, for GO terms
- scripts with this name but with diff prefixes: for DGE, continuous, other categorical features

Note
Discovered 170821: For all 54 tti prefixed features, they have been mislabeled as continuous 
when they should have been categorical (tti features are labeled as ttr, tti is categorical 
while ttr is continuous), corrected ath_ttr_clusters.txt in all_data folder, ml_dataset.txt 
and ml_dataset_dc.txt
