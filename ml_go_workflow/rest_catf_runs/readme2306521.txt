Files
combined_boxplot.png, combined_hist.png: visualises score distributions of features,
histogram has log10 y axis
combined_hist_nolog.png: histogram score distribution of features, y axis is not log10
class_labels_rcf.txt: list of the rest of categorical features
(non GO terms and DGE) as targets for ml workflow
high_rest_catf_features.txt: high scoring GO features, F1 >= 0.7, for building
network
score04_rest_catf_features.txt: same as high_rest_catf_features.txt but with F1 >= 0.4

Scripts
create_rcf_targets.py: creates list of the rest of categorical features
(non GO terms and DGE) as targets to use in my ml workflow
visualise_boxplot_scores_catf.py, visualise_hist_scores_catf.py: 
visualises distributions of oob F1 scores of categorical features,
those which scored well and those which did not. These scripts produce different types of plots.
Histogram script has log10 y axis. 
explore_scores.py: explore scores from ml workflow

Notes:
Plots of scores may not be accurate as 54 tti_ prefixed features have been mislabeled as continuous 
when they should have been categorical, hence this would have changed the frequency of scores, and
affect the plots. However, these plots would not be used as they are too general so nevermind.
