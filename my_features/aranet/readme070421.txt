Files
aranet.abc: functional gene network in abc format for mcl
aranet.graphml: functional gene network in graphml for networkx
dump.data.mci.I20: mcl clustering output, used to create cluster features
AraNet.txt: aranet file downloaded from the aranet database, raw data used to generate aranet
features (functional gene network)

Scripts
centrality_nx.py: From aranet.graphml, calculates degree and inbetweeness centrality measures
convert_nx_abc_aranet.py: Takes AraNet.txt, and converts to aranet.graphml and aranet.abc
explore_features.py: Explores functional gene network features
process_mcl.py: Creates cluster features from mcl output, dump.data.mci.I20
