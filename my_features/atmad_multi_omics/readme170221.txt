outdated: scripts and files which were used to create features which I no longer need, 
so can ignore

Files
gwas.csv, twas.csv: data from AtMAD
gwas_edited.txt: edited from gwas.csv, order of columns is slightly wrong (phenotype desc
is wrong), so had to swap some of their positions. Can cross check with AtMAD website which
has the correct ordering
twas_edited.txt: edited from twas.csv, similar error to gwas.csv, order of columns is wrong
so corrected it here
twas_edited_test.txt, gwas_edited_test.txt: smaller files based on the original files above,
used to verify that my scripts to process them works
twas_features.txt, gwas_features.txt: features file for ml, processed by my scripts using
their respective *_edited.txt files above

Scripts
process_twas.py, process_gwas.py: process their respective twas and gwas files, to make their
respective *_features.txt for ml
