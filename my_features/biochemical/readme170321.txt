ipc-1.0: IPC calculator used to calculated pI and mw for proteins, follow readme file for
instructions
outdated: Outdated stuff used for testing, no longer needed. Examples: 
- s4_IPC2_standalone is the IPC2 calculator which I tried to use but it didn't work
- result.csv, process_pI_mw_outdated.py: from web based IPC2, but doesnt have enough proteins
which i want; associated script was used to process it
- UP000006548_3702_all.fasta.pI: pI database file, but doesnt have enough proteins which I want,
so discarded

Files
ath_aa_processed.fa: protein fasta file used for IPC
results_JN.csv: IPC output
results_JN_test.csv: smaller IPC output, used for testing purposes
aa_length.txt: protein length file
ath_pi_mw.txt: pI and mw file
processed_results.txt: IPC output in tabular form

Scripts
find_pep_len.py: calculate protein length
process_pI_mw.py: Takes IPC ouput, and processes it into a tabular form, processed_results.txt
extract_pI_mw.py: Selects the desired pI and mw value from tabular IPC results, produces
ath_pi_mw.txt
