This folder contains my scripts to generate several of my features, reran
these scripts as some of them needed editing for an improved ml workflow

Does not use NA to represent missing values when writing to text files

process_ath_spm.py, process_ath_td.py, process_ath_tpm.py does not need to be edited

To find out what each script does, open them and read the comments there
