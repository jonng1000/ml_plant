data_creation_v2: Contains files scripts used for data
creation. Improved based on the data_creation folder
and contains more stuff

Folders
outdated: outdated stuff, can ignore

- process_ath_dge.py: preprocessing differential gene
expression file. Takes in DGE and produces
edited_Ath_dge.txt (outdated DGE work from Marek)
- edited_Ath_dge.txt: output file from process_ath_dge.py
(outdated DGE work from Marek)
- DGE: input file for process_ath_dge.py
(outdated DGE work from Marek)

Scripts
- adding_labels.py: Takes in a dataset, combined_data.txt,
and adds class labels to it. These are positive and negative
labels. Genes which don't have either labels are removed.
Produces Golgi_apparatus_GO.txt, which is stored in the
parent folder of data_preprocessing
- analyse_interpro_v2.py: Takes in the interproscan output
file, ath_aa_processed.fa.tsv, and does 1 hot encoding to
convert protein domains into binary features. Output file
is protein_doms.txt
- combine_data.py: Combines edited gene expression features
with protein domain features to create a dataset. Takes in
edited_Ath.txt and protein_doms.txt. Output file is
combined_data.txt
- process_ath_jtk.py: preprocessing diurnal gene
expression file. Takes in JTK.Ath_Mat.txt and produces
edited_Ath_jtk.txt, edited 251120
- process_ath_og.py: preprocessing orthogroups file. Takes in Orthogroups_Jon.txt 
and produces edited_Ath_og.txt.
- process_ath_ps.py: preprocessing phylostrata file. Takes in gene2node.txt 
and produces edited_Ath_ps.txt.
- process_ath_sc.py: preprocessing orthogroups file. Takes in Orthogroups_Jon.txt 
and produces edited_Ath_sc.txt.
- process_ath_spm.py: preprocessing gene
expression specificity file. Takes in Ath.spm and produces
edited_Ath_spm.txt
- process_ath_td.py: preprocessing orthogroups file. Takes in Orthogroups_Jon.txt,
together with Athaliana_447_Araport11.gene.gff3 and produces edited_Ath_td.txt.
- process_ath_tpm.py: preprocessing gene
expression file. Takes in Ath_matrix.av and produces
edited_Ath_tpm.txt

Files
- Ath_matrix.av: input file for process_ath_tpm.py
- Athaliana_447_Araport11.gene.gff3: genomic information file for
process_ath_td.py
- protein_doms.txt: output file from analyse_interpro.py
- protein_doms.txt.gz: .gz file from protein_doms.txt
- Ath.spm: input file for process_ath_exp.py
- edited_Ath_jtk.txt: output file from process_ath_jtk.py, edited 251120
- edited_Ath_og.txt: output file from process_ath_og.py
- edited_Ath_ps.txt: output file from process_ath_ps.py
- edited_Ath_sc.txt: output file from process_ath_sc.py
- edited_Ath_spm.txt: output file from process_ath_spm.py
- edited_Ath_td.txt: output file from process_ath_td.py
- edited_Ath_tpm.txt: output file from process_ath_tpm.py
- gene2node.txt: phylostrata file for process_ath_ps.py
- JTK.Ath_Mat.txt: diurnal gene expression file for process_ath_jtk.py
- Orthogroups_Jon.txt: orthogroups file for process_ath_og.py,
process_ath_sc.py, and process_ath_td.py
