data_creation: Contains files scripts used for data
preprocessing
- analyse_interpro.py: Takes in the interproscan output
file, ath_aa_processed.fa.tsv, and does 1 hot encoding to
convert protein domains into binary features. Output file
is protein_doms.txt
- process_ath_exp.py: preprocessing gene expression file. Takes
in Ath.spm and produces edited_Ath.txt
- combine_data.py: Combines edited gene expression features
with protein domain features to create a dataset. Takes in
edited_Ath.txt and protein_doms.txt. Output file is
combined_data.txt
- adding_labels.py: Takes in a dataset, combined_data.txt,
and adds class labels to it. These are positive and negative
labels. Genes which don't have either labels are removed.
Produces Golgi_apparatus_GO.txt, which is stored in the
parent folder of data_preprocessing
- protein_doms.txt: output file from analyse_interpro.py
- edited_Ath.txt: output file from process_ath_exp.py
- Ath.spm: input file for process_ath_exp.py

data_creation_v2: details in the folder itself
