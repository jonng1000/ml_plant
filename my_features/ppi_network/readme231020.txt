Scripts
centrality_nx.py: Calculates centrality measures, takes ath_ppi.graphml
as input and gives ath_centrality_features.txt as output
cleaning_network.py: Cleans up Biogrid Arabidopsis ppi network, takes in
BIOGRID-ORGANISM-Arabidopsis_thaliana_Columbia-4.0.189.tab3.txt and
produces ath_ppi.txt
convert_nx_abc.py: Explores Arabidopsis ppi and converts it into graphml
and abc formats. Takes in ath_ppi.txt and produces ath_ppi.graphml and
ath_ppi.abc
process_mcl.py: Produces OHE ppi clusters,and calculates cluster size.
Takes in dump.data.mci.I20 and outputs ath_ppi_clusters.txt
process_nx.py: Plots degree distribution from Arabidopsis ppi, takes in
ath_ppi.graphml and produces deg_dist.png
plot_mcl.py: Plots mcl gene clusters from ppi, takes ath_ppi_clusters.txt and
produces clusters_dist.png. Note: clusters_dist_scatter.png, clusters_dist_hist.png
and clusters_hist2.png are produced from modifications to this script, but these pictures
aren't very important
explore_features.py: explore finished features
