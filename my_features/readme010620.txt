Folders
aranet: functional gene network features

atmad_multi_omics: multiomics features, basically, correlates genes to phenotypes, from
atmad database

biochemical: biochemical features file

cis_tf: cis regulatory elements features, from AtcisDB database

coexp_network: gene coexp features

data_creation_v3: details in the folder itself, updated version of features based on
data_creation folder in the outdated folder

go_terms_features: GO terms as features

interpro_files: Contains input fasta files for interproscan
and scripts to preprocess data for interproscan. Contains
the following files and scripts.
- Athaliana_447_Araport11.cds_primaryTranscriptOnly.fa.gz:
cds file downloaded from JGI Phytozome, don't actually need
this
- Athaliana_447_Araport11.protein_primaryTranscriptOnly.fa.gz:
raw fasta file downloaded from JGI Phytozome
- Athaliana_447_Araport11.protein_primaryTranscriptOnly.fa:
unzipped file from the above
- ath_aa_processed.fa: preprocessed fasta file for interproscan
- process_fasta.py: preprocesses raw, unzipped protein fasta file
above
- ath_aa_processed.fa.tsv: interproscan output from preprocessed
fasta file

kal_sleuth_work:
Has my work involving kallisto and sleuth to get dge data,
further notes are in the readme in this folder

pnas_add: Additional features from the PNAS paper, leftover after all features in this
folder have been created

ppi_networks: work done on ppi networks, see folder readme for
details

protein_ptm: PTM features

tf_tg_coexp: transcription factr-target gene (TF-TG) regulatory network features

outdated:
outdated feature files, not used now

Scripts
get_interpro_counts.py: Explores interpro results. Takes in
ath_aa_processed.fa.tsv

Files

Notes
Making binary features from protein domains:
Protein domains are tagged with PD for easy reference in future

Gene expression features are tagged with GE for easy reference in
future (outdated as of ard Sep-Nov 2020 onwards)

If I am running any of my scripts again, may need to change file paths since I have changed the
organisation of the files, scripts and folders here

Before 210920, typically I copy my finished scripts from the workstation to my desktop, but from
now on, I've stopped it since my workstation has too many scripts to move over, so now, my
desktop and workstation can have different scripts.
