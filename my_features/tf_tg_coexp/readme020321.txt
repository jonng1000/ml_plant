Folders
outdated: outdated files, basically just testing to see if viewing the TF-TG graph as directed
and undirected has any difference in MCODE output

Files
tftg_reg_net.abc: transcription factor-target gene (TF-TG) regulatory network input file for mcl,
each row is an edge between TF and its TG
tftg_reg_net.graphml: TF-TG graph in a graph format
dump.data.mci.I20: output from MCL, uses default inflation value so am using it for my work
dump.data.mci.I40: same as above, but uses an inflation value of 4, so am not using it
Supplementary table_3_edited.xlsx: supplementary table 3 from the TF-TG paper,
https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/48/20/11347/5940494 -> this is used to get the TF-TG
features for ml
ath_ttr_clusters.txt: TF-TG network clusters for ml
feature_name_map.txt: used as a guide to create TF-TG features for ml used by
process_tf_tg_coexp.py
tf_raw_features.txt, tg_raw_features.txt: raw features file, used tgt with feature_name_map.txt
by process_tf_tg_coexp.py to create features for ml
reg_nwt_centrality_features.txt: gene regulatory network features for ml
tf_tg_network.txt: TF-TG network information, used to generate .graphml and .abc files for
downstream work
tt_coexp_features.txt: TF-TG coexpression features, used for ml
(turns out, all tf data is found in tg data, so dont need to use it)

Scripts
centrality_nx.py: calculate network centrality features, takes in tftg_reg_net.graphml and
produces reg_nwt_centrality_features.txt
convert_nx_abc_tftg.py: converts network in tabular format into graphml and abc format. Takes in
tf_tg_network.txt, and produces tftg_reg_net.graphml and tftg_reg_net.abc
explore_features.py: explore finished features
process_mcl.py: processes mcl output, takes in dump.data.mci.I20 and produces
ath_ttr_clusters.txt
process_tf_tg_coexp.py: takes in TF-TG features and processes them to select appropriate
features for ml, produces tt_coexp_features.txt

Note
Discovered 170821: For all 54 tti prefixed features, they have been mislabeled as continuous 
when they should have been categorical (tti features are labeled as ttr, tti is categorical 
while ttr is continuous), corrected process_mcl.py and its output, ath_ttr_clusters.txt
